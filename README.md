# Introduction-To-Algorithms
This is a follow along project to the book Introduction to algorithms. By which I plan to understand and have a good foundation about the basics of algorithms of all sorts and also data structures.
The code included here will probably be written in C and the files' names will probably have convenient naming to understand what each sample is all about.
Somethings like Chn-NameOfAlgo.c 
Other notes will be written by hand, so they won't be featured here.
